# CSE216: Programming Abstractions (State University of New York, Korea, Fall 2023)

# Course overview

This course is  offered by the CS Department of SUNY Korea. In this course, we will learn
Intermediate-level programming concepts and paradigms, including functional programming, object-orientation, basics of type systems, memory management, program and data abstractions, parameter passing and modularity.

This repository is publicly accessible and hosts  courseware that will be incrementally added along the semester.  We will adapt the courseware from the ones used at SUNY Korea and Stony Brook University in previous years.

# Grading: Numerical Scores

-   Homework: 20%
-   Midterm1: 25%
-   Midterm2: 25%
-   Final: 30%
-   Students with regular participation and constructive feedback get 0.5% or 1% bonus

Namely, the numerical grade for the course will be calculated as:

```
def numerical_grade(Homework, Midterm1, Midterm2, Final, Bonus):
    return 0.20 * Homework + 0.25 * Midterm1 + 0.25 * Midterm2 + 0.30 * Final + Bonus
```






# Grading: Letter Scores
